      <h1>About</h1>
      <p>
        Our intimate brunch series is about connecting creative people and ideas together into one room. Each brunch will have a guest of honor led by a short discussion around a topic they are passionate about. Each guest has been invited for a specific reason, whether it's because you're making a difference, or because we think you need to meet another talented person from our group.
